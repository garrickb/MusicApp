# Collaborative Soundcloud Listening
This web application is in a working state for streaming soundcloud audio to clients connected to the node.js server. It has a sleek UI and is completely anonymous for the users, no login required.

To add songs to the song queue, just find the URL of the soundcloud song you wish to play, and copy+paste it into the song request bar.
